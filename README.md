# WLMap

## Description
This is a navigational android app used to navigate inside buildings to find classrooms, stairs, elevators, and bathrooms. 

## Features
This app can provide accurate mapping of Davis Hall, real-time location tracking, and navigational directions to any point within Davis Hall.

## Tools
Kotlin and Android Studio are used to create the application on the Android platform, more specifically, a Google Pixel 7A.

## Directory Files and Locations
The directory, app/src/main, contains the following files:

1. assets
   - sprite_images
       - 1.1.1 exit-door-svgrepo-com.svg
   - style.json
2. java/com/example/wlmap
   - Graph.kt
      - Create a graph where the nodes are the navigation points (ID, longitude, latitude, and set of neighboring nodes) on the map and the edge is the Haversine distance between the two nodes. Afterward, we use Dijkstra's Algorithm to navigate the shortest path between two points and return a list of points that needed to take.
   - LocationPermissionHelper.kt
   - MainActivity.kt
     - Uses Android sensor to display Accelerator and Gyroscope readings
   - MqttHandler.kt
   - NavPoint.kt
      - An abstract data class that works as a constructor to navigate the path between two points.

## Project Roadmap

- [x] User can select any point in Davis Hall and can get navigational directions.
- [x] The point the user selects is marked and displayed with a circle.
- [x] Latitude and longitude coordinates are displayed on the point that the user selects.
- [ ] User can travel to any point within a room in Davis Hall [WIP]
