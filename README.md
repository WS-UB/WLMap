# WLMap

## Description
WLMap (Wireless Localization Map) is an Android app used to navigate inside buildings to find classrooms, stairs, elevators, and bathrooms. The goal is to create a stable Android mobile application for indoor navigation and WiFi-based data collection. 

## Features
This app can provide accurate mapping of Davis Hall, real-time location tracking, and navigational directions to any point within Davis Hall.

## Goals and Challenges
Our current goals for this project include:
   - Resolving technical issues with the data collection app.
   - Developing a functional navigational interface.
   - Enhancing the the front-end user interface.
   - Integrating server-side data processing using AWS.

## Tools
Kotlin and Android Studio are used to create the application on the Android platform, more specifically, a Google Pixel 7A.

## Directory Files and Locations
The directory, app/src/main, contains the following files:

1. assets
   - sprite_images
       - 1.1.1 exit-door-svgrepo-com.svg
   - style.json
2. java/com/example/wlmap
   - Graph.kt
      - Create a graph where the nodes are the navigation points (ID, longitude, latitude, and set of neighboring nodes) on the map and the edge is the Haversine distance between the two nodes. Afterward, we use Dijkstra's Algorithm to navigate the shortest path between two points and return a list of points that needed to take.
   - LocationPermissionHelper.kt
   - MainActivity.kt
   - MqttHandler.kt
   - NavPoint.kt
      - An abstract data class that works as a constructor to navigate the path between two points.

     - Select "Run selected steps."
     - After the update is complete, select "Refresh."

4. Select "Device Manager" on the right-side app bar and install the device emulator.
   - If there are any other created devices, end their processes and remove them.
   - Click the "+" to and select "Create Virtual Device."
   - Select the "Phone" category and select the Pixel 7a (API 35).
   - Press "Finish."
   - After the device is installed, select the "play" button next to the installed device to begin running it.

## Project Roadmap

- [x] User can select any point in Davis Hall and can get navigational directions.
- [x] The point the user selects is marked and displayed with a circle.
- [x] Latitude and longitude coordinates are displayed on the point that the user selects.
- [x] User can travel to any point within a room in Davis Hall.
